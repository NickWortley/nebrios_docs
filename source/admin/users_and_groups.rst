Users And Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a user here will by default allow them to interact with your system. This way they can send emails and interact with processes in action, or trigger new process instances.

You can add users to groups, which is used for convenience in other parts of the admin, like the ACL settings.

If you mark a user as an admin, they will have privileges over everything in the administration side of the website, just like you. Usually only a couple admins are necessary, while many standard users are normal.
