*************************
Access Control List (ACL)
*************************

This is where you can define who can access which KVPs on your system. When a user is disallowed from viewing a KVP, it will not show up in any email or communication to them. Nor will they have access to modify it. An example of an ACL setting is to protect employees from seeing the pay\_rate of a new hire.

Registered

    This group name is reserved also. Any user that is registered in your system falls under this group automatically.
