Using the Admin
===============

The admin website allows you to write scripts and forms, monitor KVPs, understand what processes have been started (and why), set permissions for users, and many other things. You might be looking for a graphical overview of a process, like a BPMN representation with bubbles grayed out that have already been executed. That type of view does not exist, and cannot exist, since processes aren't technically defined in any one place. With the advent of Process Contracts, and Event Based scripting, power lies by creating assurance from various angles. It's a visibility vs. assurance issue.
