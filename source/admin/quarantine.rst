Quarantine
~~~~~~~~~~

This is a place where all your sick scripts go. If ever a script is triggered and unable to completely run because of an error, you will fine it listed in the quarantine. There you will see the script name and time of error, along with the error message that was generated.

It gets better! Once the script is updated in any way (probably in hopes of fixing the error), it's triggered again to try and run and the old quarantine is deleted. Should the script happen to error again it will create a new quarantine. Otherwise, you are good to go.
