This feature allows you to define in a script certain KVP values which **must** be available to the script before it continues forward. An example would be a list of paperwork. Each item must be inputted into the system before the script moves forward.

If the required KVPs aren't there when the script executes, it sends an email back to the last actor telling them they missed certain information.
